Any container not picked up in the period following its delivery incurs a penalty cost resulting primarily from operating costs and customer dissatisfaction. The result is a dynamic logistics planning problem where in each delivery period the vehicle dispatcher needs to design a multi-stop vehicle route while determining the container quantities to be picked up at each stop. This research is unique in that route design and pickup strategies are developed simultaneously, where stop volumes are known only probabilistically over a planning horizon.

This is a departure from classical vehicle routing problems where one seeks to minimize total travel time in a static, deterministic environment. Potential areas of application include repair, inventory, emergency service and scheduling problems. The {DTRP} is defined as follows: Demands for service arrive in time according to a Poisson process, are independent and uniformly distributed in a Euclidean service region, and require an independent and identically distributed amount of on-site service by a vehicle. The problem is to find a policy for routing the service vehicle that minimizes the average time demands spent in the system. We propose and analyze several policies for the {DTRP.} We find a provably optimal policy in light traffic and several policies with system times within a constant factor of the optimal policy in heavy traffic. We also show that the waiting time grows much faster than in traditional queues as the traffic intensity increases, yet the stability condition does not depend on the system geometry.",

These algorithms define the set of customers to be serviced each day and produce routes for a fleet of vehicles to service those customers. Two algorithms are compared in detail, one which first allocates deliveries to days and then solves a vehicle routing problem and a second which treats the multi-day problem as a modified vehicle routing problem.

This problem arises in several contexts, e.g., in the design of less-than-truckload collection routes. Because of uncertainty, it may not be possible to follow vehicle routes as planned. Using a stochastic programming framework, the problem is solved in two stages. In a first stage, planned collection routes are designed. In a second stage, when the set of present customers is known, these routes are followed as planned by skipping the absent customers. Whenever the vehicle capacity is attained or exceeded, the vehicle returns to the depot and resumes its collections along the planned route. This generates a penalty. The problem is to design a first stage solution in order to minimize the expected total cost of the second state solution. This is formulated as a stochastic integer program, and solved for the first time to optimality by means of an integer L-shaped method.",

The problem is a pick-up or delivery vehicle routing problem with soft time windows in which we consider multiple vehicles with different capacities, real-time service requests, and real-time variations in travel times between demand nodes. The performance of the genetic algorithm is evaluated by comparing its results with exact solutions and lower bounds for randomly generated test problems. For small size problems with up to 10 demands, the genetic algorithm provides almost the same results as the exact solutions, while its computation time is less than 10\% of the time required to produce the exact solutions. For the problems with 30 demand nodes, the genetic algorithm results have less than 8\% gap with lower bounds. This research also shows that as the uncertainty in the travel time information increases, a dynamic routing strategy that takes the real-time traffic information into account becomes increasingly superior to a static one. This is clear when we compare the static and dynamic routing strategies in problem scenarios that have different levels of uncertainty in travel time information. In additional tests on a simulated network, the proposed algorithm works well in dealing with situations in which accidents cause significant congestion in some part of the transportation network.",

The latency of a customer p is defined to be the distance traveled (time elapsed) before visiting p for the first time. Previous literature on the {KTR} problem has considered the version of the problem in which the repairtime of a customer is assumed to be zero for latency calculations. We consider a generalization of the problem in which each customer has an associated repairtime. For a fixed k, we present a ([beta]+2)-approximation algorithm for this problem, where [beta] is the best achievable approximation ratio for the {KTR} problem with zero repairtimes (currently [beta]=6). For arbitrary k, we obtain a -approximation ratio. When the repairtimes of the customers are all the same, we present an approximation algorithm with a better ratio.2 We also introduce the bounded-latency problem, a complementary version of the {KTR} problem, in which we are given a latency bound L and are asked to find the minimum number of repairmen required to service all the customers such that the latency of no customer is more than L. For this problem, we present a simple bicriteria approximation algorithm that finds a solution with at most 2/[rho] times the number of repairmen required by an optimal solution, with the latency of no customer exceeding {(1+[rho])L,} [rho]{\textgreater}0.",

In the capacitated version {(CVRP)} the total demand collected along a route cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. This article considers the situation where some ofthe demands are stochastic. This implies that the level of demand at each customer is not known before arriving at the customer. In some cases, the vehicle may thus be unable to load the customer's demand, even ifthe expected demand along the route does not exceed the vehicle capacity. Such a situation is referred to as a failure. The capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands {(SVRP)} then consists ofminimizing the total cost ofthe planned routes and of expected failures. Here, penalties for failures correspond to return trips to the depot. The vehicle first returns to the depot to unload, then resumes its trip as originally planned. This article studies an implementation of the Integer L-shaped method for the exact solution of the {SVRP.} It develops new lower bounds on the expected penalty for failures. In addition, it provides variants of the optimality cuts for the {SVRP} that also hold at fractional solutions.

The first class, discussed in this paper, deals with the transportation of goods from the depot to linehaul customers and from backhaul customers to the depot. This class is denoted as Vehicle Routing Problems with Backhauls {(VRPB).} Four subtypes can be considered, namely the Vehicle Routing Problem with Clustered Backhauls {(VRPCB} {\^a}ÂÂ all linehauls before backhauls), the Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed linehauls and Backhauls {(VRPMB} {\^a}ÂÂ any sequence of linehauls and backhauls permitted), the Vehicle Routing Problem with Divisible Delivery and Pickup {(VRPDDP} {\^a}ÂÂ customers demanding delivery and pickup service can be visited twice), and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Delivery and Pickup {(VRPSDP} {\^a}ÂÂ customers demanding both services have to be visited exactly once). The second class, dealt with in the second part of this survey, refers to all those problems where goods are transported between pickup and delivery locations. These are the Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem {(PDVRP} {\^a}ÂÂ unpaired pickup and delivery points), the classical Pickup and Delivery Problem {(PDP} {\^a}ÂÂ paired pickup and delivery points), and the {Dial-A-Ride} Problem {(DARP} {\^a}ÂÂ passenger transportation between paired pickup and delivery points and user inconvenience taken into consideration). Single as well as multi vehicle versions of the mathematical problem formulations are given for all four {VRPB} types, the corresponding exact, heuristic, and metaheuristic solution methods are discussed.",

The focus is on the efficient and effective management of waste lube oils collection and recycling operations. The emphasis is given on the systemic dimensions and modular architecture of the proposed DSS. The latter incorporates intra- and inter-city vehicle routing with real-life operational constraints using shortest path and sophisticated hybrid metaheuristic algorithms. It is also integrated with an Enterprise Resource Planning system allowing the utilization of particular functional modules and the combination with other peripheral planning tools. Furthermore, the proposed DSS provides a framework for on-line monitoring and reporting to all stages of the waste collection processes. The system is developed using a web architecture that enables sharing of information and algorithms among multiple sites, along with wireless telecommunication facilities. The application to an industrial environment showed improved productivity and competitiveness, indicating its applicability on realistic reverse logistical planning problems.

	abstract = "The paper considers a version of the vehicle routing problem where customers' demands are uncertain. The focus is on dynamically routing a single vehicle to serve the demands of a known set of geographically dispersed customers during real-time operations. The goal consists of minimizing the expected distance traveled in order to serve all customers' demands. Since actual demand is revealed upon arrival of the vehicle at the location of each customer, fully exploiting this feature requires a dynamic approach. This work studies the suitability of the emerging field of neuro-dynamic programming {(NDP)} in providing approximate solutions to this difficult stochastic combinatorial optimization problem. The paper compares the performance of two {NDP} algorithms: optimistic approximate policy iteration and a rollout policy. While the former improves the performance of a nearest-neighbor policy by 2.3\%, the computational results indicate that the rollout policy generates higher quality solutions. The implication for the practitioner is that the rollout policy is a promising candidate for vehicle routing applications where a dynamic approach is {required.Scope} and purpose Recent years have seen a growing interest in the development of vehicle routing algorithms to cope with the uncertain and dynamic situations found in real-world applications (see the recent survey paper by Powell et al. [1]). As noted by Psaraftis [2], dramatic advances in information and communication technologies provide new possibilities and opportunities for vehicle routing research and applications. The enhanced capability of capturing the information that becomes available during real-time operations opens up new research directions. This informational availability provides the possibility of developing dynamic routing algorithms that take advantage of the information that is dynamically revealed during operations. Exploiting such information presents a significant challenge to the operations research/management science community. The single vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands [3] provides an example of a simple, yet very difficult to solve exactly, dynamic vehicle routing problem [2, p. 157]. The problem can be formulated as a stochastic shortest path problem [4] characterized by an enormous number of states. Neuro-dynamic programming [5 and 6] is a recent methodology that can be used to approximately solve very large and complex stochastic decision and control problems. In this spirit, this paper is meant to study the applicability of neuro-dynamic programming algorithms to the single-vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands.",

The restocking points may be before a stockout actually occurs. Two heuristic algorithms are developed to construct both single and multiple routes that minimize total travel cost.

Fast approximations of the objective function are therefore appealing because they would allow for an extended exploration of the search space. We explore the hybridization of the metaheuristic by means of two objective functions which are surrogate measures of the exact solution quality. Particularly helpful for some metaheuristics is the objective function derived from the traveling salesman problem {(TSP)}, a closely related problem. In the light of this observation, we analyze possible extensions of the metaheuristics which take the hybridized solution approach {VRPSD-TSP} even further and report about experimental results on different types of instances. We show that, for the instances tested, two hybridized versions of iterated local search and evolutionary algorithm attain better solutions than state-of-the-art algorithms.",

Given only a probabilistic description of the demand we need to design routes for the {VRP.} Motivated by applications in strategic planning and distribution systems, rather than resolving the problem when the demand becomes known, we propose to construct an a priori sequence among all customers of minimal expected total length. We analyze the problem using a variety of theoretical approaches. We find closed-form expressions and algorithms to compute the expected length of an a priori sequence under general probabilistic assumptions. Based on these expressions we find upper and lower bounds for the probabilistic {VRP} and the {VRP} re-optimization strategy, in which we find the optimal route at every instance. We propose heuristics and analyze their worst case performance as well as their average behavior using techniques from probabilistic analysis. Our results suggest that our approach is a strong and useful alternative to the strategy of re-optimization in capacitated routing problems.",

In the model, a finite collection of tours are dynamically dispatched to deliver loads that arrive randomly over time. A load waits in queue until it is assigned to a tour. This representation, which is analogous to classical set-covering models, can be used to study a variety of dynamic routing and load consolidation problems. We characterize the optimal work in the system in heavy traffic using a lower bound from our earlier work (Gans and van Ryzin 1997) and an upper bound which is based on a simple batching policy. These results give considerable insight into how various parameters of the problem affect system congestion. In addition, our analysis suggests a practical heuristic which, in simulation experiments, significantly outperforms more conventional dispatching policies. The heuristic uses a few simple principles to control congestion, principles which can be easily incorporated within classical, static routing algorithms.",

Despite its wide practical applicability the {MC-VRP} has not received much attention in the literature, and the few existing methods assume perfect knowledge of the customer demands, regardless of their stochastic nature. This paper extends the {MC-VRP} by introducing uncertainty on what it is known as the {MC-VRP} with stochastic demands {(MC-VRPSD).} The {MC-VRPSD} is modeled as a stochastic program with recourse and solved by means of a memetic algorithm. The proposed memetic algorithm couples genetic operators and local search procedures proven to be effective on deterministic routing problems with a novel individual evaluation and reparation strategy that accounts for the stochastic nature of the problem. The algorithm was tested on instances of up to 484 customers, and its results were compared to those obtained by a savings-based heuristic and a memetic algorithm {(MA/SCS)} for the {MC-VRP} that uses a spare capacity strategy to handle demand fluctuations. In addition to effectively solve the {MC-VRPSD}, the proposed {MA/SCS} also improved 14 best known solutions in a 40-problem testbed for the {MC-VRP.}",
