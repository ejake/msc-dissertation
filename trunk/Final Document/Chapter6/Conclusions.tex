\begin{itemize}
 \item Although the genetic operators attempt to explore by extending the search space to avoid local optimum. This operators by themselves do not improve the solutions. So, it is necessary to focus on local search to improve the quality solutions and the convergence.
 \item When the instances size increase, the distance between the quality of solutions found by memetic algorithm and the solutions computed by others algorithms increase as well.
 \item Not only the memetic algorithm's results are better than others algorithms' results, its outcomes have also less variability.
 \item The memetic consumes similar running time in large instances than basic genetic algorithm but its results are better.
 \item Although the hybridization approach increases the computational time cost, this effort is rewarded in many cases given that the quality of the solutions is better than if we apply the rollout algorithm alone. 
 \item The rollout algorithm is inexpensive in comparison with others techniques.
 \item The genetic algorithm is more inexpensive than the memetic one in small and medium instances.
 \item The rollout is better than the basic genetic algorithm since it obtains better results by employing less computational resources.
%resources 
 \item Local search is the most time-consuming component.
 \item The expected distance evaluation consumes a lot of execution time. An efficient approximation improves the algorithm performance.
%convergence
 \item In the behavior of the genetic algorithms with small and medium instances, we observe that if local search is applied the evolutionary algorithm stops when the number of iterations is achived, rather than with the basic genetic algorithm which often completes the maximun counting of iterations without significative change. This contrast with the behavior that we expected since local search accelerates the solution convergence in the memetic algorithm. However, we do observe this behavior in large instances.
 %Contrast
 \item Despite that the basic genetic algorithm often expends less time, the hybrid approach finds a solution employing less time for many large instances. The memetic algorithm can perform less iterations since it obtains an unbeatable solution earlier. This induces the algorithm to stop  because it accomplishes the number of iterations whitout significative change.
