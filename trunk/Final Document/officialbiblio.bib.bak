  abstract = {A reverse logistics problem, motivated by blood distribution of the
	American Red Cross, is examined where containers in which products
	are delivered from a central processing point to customers (stops)
	in one period are available for return to the central point in the
	following period. Any container not picked up in the period following
	its delivery incurs a penalty cost resulting primarily from operating
	costs and customer dissatisfaction. The result is a dynamic logistics
	planning problem where in each delivery period the vehicle dispatcher
	needs to design a multi-stop vehicle route while determining the
	container quantities to be picked up at each stop. This research
	is unique in that route design and pickup strategies are developed
	simultaneously, where stop volumes are known only probabilistically
	over a planning horizon. A heuristic procedure is developed for treating
	the route design-pickup strategy planning problem. Keywords: Reverse
	logistics; Vehicle routing; Pickup and delivery },

	Para solucionar este problema se propone un algoritmo heurístico

  abstract = {We propose and analyze a generic mathematical model for dynamic, stochastic
	vehicle routing problems, the dynamic traveling repairman problem
	{(DTRP).} The model is motivated by applications in which the objective
	is to minimize the wait for service in a stochastic and dynamically
	changing environment. This is a departure from classical vehicle
	routing problems where one seeks to minimize total travel time in
	a static, deterministic environment. Potential areas of application
	include repair, inventory, emergency service and scheduling problems.
	The {DTRP} is defined as follows: Demands for service arrive in time
	according to a Poisson process, are independent and uniformly distributed
	in a Euclidean service region, and require an independent and identically
	distributed amount of on-site service by a vehicle. The problem is
	to find a policy for routing the service vehicle that minimizes the
	average time demands spent in the system. We propose and analyze
	several policies for the {DTRP.} We find a provably optimal policy
	in light traffic and several policies with system times within a
	constant factor of the optimal policy in heavy traffic. We also show
	that the waiting time grows much faster than in traditional queues
	as the traffic intensity increases, yet the stability condition does
	not depend on the system geometry.},

	in the design of less-than-truckload collection routes. Because of
	uncertainty, it may not be possible to follow vehicle routes as planned.
	Using a stochastic programming framework, the problem is solved in
	two stages. In a first stage, planned collection routes are designed.
	In a second stage, when the set of present customers is known, these
	routes are followed as planned by skipping the absent customers.
	Whenever the vehicle capacity is attained or exceeded, the vehicle
	returns to the depot and resumes its collections along the planned

	vehicle routing problem with soft time windows in which we consider
	multiple vehicles with different capacities, real-time service requests,
	and real-time variations in travel times between demand nodes. The
	performance of the genetic algorithm is evaluated by comparing its
	results with exact solutions and lower bounds for randomly generated

	to produce the exact solutions. For the problems with 30 demand nodes,
	the genetic algorithm results have less than 8\% gap with lower bounds.
	This research also shows that as the uncertainty in the travel time
	information increases, a dynamic routing strategy that takes the
	real-time traffic information into account becomes increasingly superior
	to a static one. This is clear when we compare the static and dynamic
	routing strategies in problem scenarios that have different levels

	as the minimum latency problem, asks for k tours, each starting at
	s and together covering all the vertices (customers) such that the
	sum of the latencies experienced by the customers is minimum. The
	latency of a customer p is defined to be the distance traveled (time
	elapsed) before visiting p for the first time. Previous literature
	on the {KTR} problem has considered the version of the problem in
	which the repairtime of a customer is assumed to be zero for latency
	calculations. We consider a generalization of the problem in which
	each customer has an associated repairtime. For a fixed k, we present
	a ([beta]+2)-approximation algorithm for this problem, where [beta]
	is the best achievable approximation ratio for the {KTR} problem
	with zero repairtimes (currently [beta]=6). For arbitrary k, we obtain
	a -approximation ratio. When the repairtimes of the customers are
	all the same, we present an approximation algorithm with a better
	ratio.2 We also introduce the bounded-latency problem, a complementary
	version of the {KTR} problem, in which we are given a latency bound
	L and are asked to find the minimum number of repairmen required
	to service all the customers such that the latency of no customer
	is more than L. For this problem, we present a simple bicriteria
	approximation algorithm that finds a solution with at most 2/[rho]
	times the number of repairmen required by an optimal solution, with
	the latency of no customer exceeding {(1+[rho])L,} [rho]{\textgreater}0.},

	routes for m identical vehicles, starting and leaving at the depot,
	such that every customer is visited exactly once. In the capacitated
	version {(CVRP)} the total demand collected along a route cannot
	exceed the vehicle capacity. This article considers the situation
	where some ofthe demands are stochastic. This implies that the level
	of demand at each customer is not known before arriving at the customer.
	In some cases, the vehicle may thus be unable to load the customer's
	demand, even ifthe expected demand along the route does not exceed
	the vehicle capacity. Such a situation is referred to as a failure.
	The capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands {(SVRP)}
	then consists ofminimizing the total cost ofthe planned routes and
	of expected failures. Here, penalties for failures correspond to
	return trips to the depot. The vehicle first returns to the depot
	to unload, then resumes its trip as originally planned. This article
	studies an implementation of the Integer L-shaped method for the
	exact solution of the {SVRP.} It develops new lower bounds on the
	expected penalty for failures. In addition, it provides variants
	of the optimality cuts for the {SVRP} that also hold at fractional

  abstract = {This paper examines approximate dynamic programming algorithms for
	the single-vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands from a
	dynamic or reoptimization perspective. The methods extend the rollout
	algorithm by implementing different base sequences (i.e. a priori
	solutions), look-ahead policies, and pruning schemes. The paper also
	considers computing the cost-to-go with Monte Carlo simulation in
	addition to direct approaches. The best new method found is a two-step
	lookahead rollout started with a stochastic base sequence. The routing
	cost is about 4.8\% less than the one-step rollout algorithm started
	with a deterministic sequence. Results also show that Monte Carlo
	cost-to-go estimation reduces computation time 65\% in large instances
	with little or no loss in solution quality. Moreover, the paper compares
	results to the perfect information case from solving exact a posteriori
	solutions for sampled vehicle routing problems. The confidence interval
	for the overall mean difference is (3.56\%, 4.11\%).},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper is the first part of a comprehensive survey on
	pickup and delivery problems. Basically, two problem classes can
	be distinguished. The first class, discussed in this paper, deals
	with the transportation of goods from the depot to linehaul customers
	and from backhaul customers to the depot. This class is denoted as
	Vehicle Routing Problems with Backhauls {(VRPB).} Four subtypes can
	be considered, namely the Vehicle Routing Problem with Clustered
	Backhauls {(VRPCB} â all linehauls before backhauls), the Vehicle
	Routing Problem with Mixed linehauls and Backhauls {(VRPMB} â
	any sequence of linehauls and backhauls permitted), the Vehicle Routing
	Problem with Divisible Delivery and Pickup {(VRPDDP} â customers
	demanding delivery and pickup service can be visited twice), and
	the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Delivery and Pickup
	{(VRPSDP} â customers demanding both services have to be visited
	exactly once). The second class, dealt with in the second part of
	this survey, refers to all those problems where goods are transported
	between pickup and delivery locations. These are the Pickup and Delivery
	Vehicle Routing Problem {(PDVRP} â unpaired pickup and delivery
	points), the classical Pickup and Delivery Problem {(PDP} â
	paired pickup and delivery points), and the {Dial-A-Ride} Problem
	{(DARP} â passenger transportation between paired pickup and
	delivery points and user inconvenience taken into consideration).
	Single as well as multi vehicle versions of the mathematical problem
	formulations are given for all four {VRPB} types, the corresponding
	exact, heuristic, and metaheuristic solution methods are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a web-based decision support system (DSS) that
	enables schedulers to tackle reverse supply chain management problems

  abstract = {The paper considers a version of the vehicle routing problem where
	customers' demands are uncertain. The focus is on dynamically routing
	a single vehicle to serve the demands of a known set of geographically
	dispersed customers during real-time operations. The goal consists
	of minimizing the expected distance traveled in order to serve all
	customers' demands. Since actual demand is revealed upon arrival
	of the vehicle at the location of each customer, fully exploiting
	this feature requires a dynamic approach. This work studies the suitability
	of the emerging field of neuro-dynamic programming {(NDP)} in providing
	approximate solutions to this difficult stochastic combinatorial
	optimization problem. The paper compares the performance of two {NDP}
	algorithms: optimistic approximate policy iteration and a rollout
	policy. While the former improves the performance of a nearest-neighbor
	policy by 2.3\%, the computational results indicate that the rollout
	policy generates higher quality solutions. The implication for the
	practitioner is that the rollout policy is a promising candidate
	for vehicle routing applications where a dynamic approach is {required.Scope}
	and purpose Recent years have seen a growing interest in the development
	of vehicle routing algorithms to cope with the uncertain and dynamic
	situations found in real-world applications (see the recent survey
	paper by Powell et al. [1]). As noted by Psaraftis [2], dramatic
	advances in information and communication technologies provide new
	possibilities and opportunities for vehicle routing research and
	applications. The enhanced capability of capturing the information
	that becomes available during real-time operations opens up new research
	directions. This informational availability provides the possibility
	of developing dynamic routing algorithms that take advantage of the
	information that is dynamically revealed during operations. Exploiting
	such information presents a significant challenge to the operations
	research/management science community. The single vehicle routing
	problem with stochastic demands [3] provides an example of a simple,
	yet very difficult to solve exactly, dynamic vehicle routing problem
	[2, p. 157]. The problem can be formulated as a stochastic shortest
	path problem [4] characterized by an enormous number of states. Neuro-dynamic
	programming [5 and 6] is a recent methodology that can be used to
	approximately solve very large and complex stochastic decision and
	control problems. In this spirit, this paper is meant to study the
	applicability of neuro-dynamic programming algorithms to the single-vehicle
	routing problem with stochastic demands.},
