Given that local search is performed every time a new solution si generated often memetic algorithms employ long runnig times. 

Local search is the most time-consuming component.

Evaluate expected distance consume a lot of execution time, efficiently approximation improve the algorithm performance.

Focus local search improve the quality solutions and the convergency.
