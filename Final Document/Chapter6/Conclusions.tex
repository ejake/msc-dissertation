\section{Conclusions}

Although the hybridization approach increases the computational time cost, this effort is rewarded in many cases given that the quality of the solutions is improved than if we apply the rollout algorithm alone. 

Hence, since the local searchis performed every time a new solution is generated.

Often memetic algorithms employ long runnig times because local search is the most time-consuming component. For this reason, we partialy apply the rollout algorithm in large instances to reduce the time consumption to compute the solution.

Although the genetic operators attempt to explore by extending the search space to avoid local optimum. This operators by themselves do not improve the solutions. So, it is necessary to focus on local search to improve the quality solutions and the convergence.

To evaluate expected distance consume a lot of computational time, so an efficient approximation improves the algorithm performance.

Given that local search is performed every time a new solution si generated often memetic algorithms employ long runnig times. 

Local search is the most time-consuming component.

Evaluate expected distance consume a lot of execution time, efficiently approximation improve the algorithm performance.

Focus local search improve the quality solutions and the convergency.

when local search is applied the evolutionary algorithm stops when the number of iterations is achived.
